# Recoats-Adventure-Park-CSV-
School project

This Python project is a console-based financial analysis tool created for a school assignment. It reads from a CSV file containing daily income records from Recoats Adventure Park and allows users to interactively explore the data. Users can view total income by source (tickets, gift shop, snack stand, pictures), analyze cash vs. card payment types, and see how income is distributed across different days of the week. The project strengthened my understanding of pandas for data manipulation, user input handling, and modular code design. It demonstrates how simple tools can offer real-time insights into financial trends.
